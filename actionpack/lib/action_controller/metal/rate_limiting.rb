    module ClassMethods
      # Applies a rate limit to all actions or those specified by the normal
      # `before_action` filters with `only:` and `except:`.
      #
      # The maximum number of requests allowed is specified `to:` and constrained to
      # the window of time given by `within:`.
      #
      # Rate limits are unique to the IP address making the request, by default.
      # You can provide your own identity function by passing a method name or a callable in the `by:`
      # parameter. Callables are evaluated within the context of the controller processing the
      # request.
      #
      # Requests that exceed the rate limit will raise an `ActionController::TooManyRequests`
      # error. By default, Action Dispatch will rescue from the error and refuse the request
      # with a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
      #
      # You can specialize this by passing either a method name or a callable in the `with:`
      # parameter. Callables are evaluated within the context of the controller processing the
      # request.
      #
      # Rate limiting relies on a backing `ActiveSupport::Cache` store and defaults to
      # `config.action_controller.cache_store`, which itself defaults to the global
      # `config.cache_store`. If you don't want to store rate limits in the same
      # datastore as your general caches, you can pass a custom store in the `store`
      # parameter.
      #
      # If you want to use multiple rate limits per controller, you need to give each of
      # them an explicit name via the `name:` option.
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      #     class SessionsController < ApplicationController
      #       rate_limit to: 10, within: 3.minutes, only: :create
      #     end
      #
      #     class SignupsController < ApplicationController
      #       rate_limit to: 1000, within: 10.seconds,
      #         by: -> { request.domain }, with: :redirect_to_busy, only: :new
      #
      #       private
      #         def redirect_to_busy
      #           redirect_to busy_controller_url, alert: "Too many signups on domain!"
      #         end
      #     end
      #
      #     class APIController < ApplicationController
      #       RATE_LIMIT_STORE = ActiveSupport::Cache::RedisCacheStore.new(url: ENV["REDIS_URL"])
      #       rate_limit to: 10, within: 3.minutes, store: RATE_LIMIT_STORE
      #     end
      #
      #     class SessionsController < ApplicationController
      #       rate_limit to: 3, within: 2.seconds, name: "short-term"
      #       rate_limit to: 10, within: 5.minutes, name: "long-term"
      #     end
