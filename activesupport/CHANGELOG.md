*   `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes#attributes` now will return a new hash object on each call.

    Previously, the same hash object was returned each time that method was called.

*   `ActiveSupport::JSON.encode` supports CIDR notation.

    Previously:

    ```ruby
    ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(IPAddr.new("172.16.0.0/24")) # => "\"172.16.0.0\""
    ```

    After this change:

    ```ruby
    ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(IPAddr.new("172.16.0.0/24")) # => "\"172.16.0.0/24\""
    ```
