  module Connection
    # # Action Cable Connection Base
    #
    # For every WebSocket connection the Action Cable server accepts, a Connection
    # object will be instantiated. This instance becomes the parent of all of the
    # channel subscriptions that are created from there on. Incoming messages are
    # then routed to these channel subscriptions based on an identifier sent by the
    # Action Cable consumer. The Connection itself does not deal with any specific
    # application logic beyond authentication and authorization.
    #
    # Here's a basic example:
    #
    #     module ApplicationCable
    #       class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    #         identified_by :current_user
    #
    #         def connect
    #           self.current_user = find_verified_user
    #           logger.add_tags current_user.name
    #         end
    #
    #         def disconnect
    #           # Any cleanup work needed when the cable connection is cut.
    #         end
    #
    #         private
    #           def find_verified_user
    #             User.find_by_identity(cookies.encrypted[:identity_id]) ||
    #               reject_unauthorized_connection
    #           end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # First, we declare that this connection can be identified by its current_user.
    # This allows us to later be able to find all connections established for that
    # current_user (and potentially disconnect them). You can declare as many
    # identification indexes as you like. Declaring an identification means that an
    # attr_accessor is automatically set for that key.
    #
    # Second, we rely on the fact that the WebSocket connection is established with
    # the cookies from the domain being sent along. This makes it easy to use signed
    # cookies that were set when logging in via a web interface to authorize the
    # WebSocket connection.
    #
    # Finally, we add a tag to the connection-specific logger with the name of the
    # current user to easily distinguish their messages in the log.
    #
    # Pretty simple, eh?
